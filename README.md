**Mechanical enforcement tools to prevent AI agents from bypassing established project standards.**

**Works with:** Claude Code | Clawdbot | Any AI coding agent

> Rules in markdown are suggestions. Code hooks are laws.

## The Problem

You spend hours building validation pipelines, scoring systems, and verification logic. Then your AI agent writes a "quick version" that bypasses all of it. Sound familiar?

This isn't a prompting problem — it's an enforcement problem. More markdown rules won't fix it. You need mechanical enforcement.

## Enforcement Hierarchy

| Level | Method | Reliability |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Code hooks** (pre-commit, creation guards) | 100% |
| 2 | **Architectural constraints** (import registries) | 95% |
| 3 | **Self-verification loops** | 80% |
| 4 | **Prompt rules** (AGENTS.md) | 60-70% |
| 5 | **Markdown documentation** | 40-50% ⚠️ |

This toolkit focuses on levels 1-2: the ones that actually work.

## What's Included

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/install.sh` | One-command project setup |
| `scripts/pre-create-check.sh` | Lists existing modules before you create new files |
| `scripts/post-create-validate.sh` | Detects duplicate functions and missing imports |
| `scripts/check-secrets.sh` | Scans for hardcoded tokens/keys/passwords |
| `assets/pre-commit-hook` | Git hook that blocks bypass patterns + secrets |
| `assets/registry-template.py` | Template `__init__.py` for import enforcement |
| `references/agents-md-template.md` | Battle-tested AGENTS.md template |
| `references/enforcement-research.md` | Full research on why code > prompts |

## Quick Start

**For Claude Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jzOcb/agent-guardrails ~/.claude/skills/agent-guardrails
cd your-project && bash ~/.claude/skills/agent-guardrails/scripts/install.sh .
```

**For Clawdbot:**
```bash
clawdhub install agent-guardrails
```

**Manual:**
```bash
bash /path/to/agent-guardrails/scripts/install.sh /path/to/your/project
```

📖 [Claude Code detailed guide](./CLAUDE_CODE_INSTALL.md)

This will:
- ✅ Install git pre-commit hook (blocks bypass patterns + hardcoded secrets)
- ✅ Create `__init__.py` registry template  
- ✅ Copy check scripts to your project
- ✅ Add enforcement rules to your AGENTS.md

## Usage

### Before creating any new file:
```bash
bash scripts/pre-create-check.sh /path/to/project
```
Shows existing modules and functions. If it already exists, **import it**.

### After creating/editing a file:
```bash
bash scripts/post-create-validate.sh /path/to/new_file.py
```
Catches duplicate functions, missing imports, and bypass patterns like "simplified version" or "temporary".

### Secret scanning:
```bash
bash scripts/check-secrets.sh /path/to/project
```

## How It Works

### Pre-commit Hook
Automatically blocks commits containing:
- Bypass patterns: `"simplified version"`, `"quick version"`, `"temporary"`, `"TODO: integrate"`
- Hardcoded secrets: API keys, tokens, passwords in source code

### Pre-create Check
Before writing new code, the script shows you:
- All existing Python modules in the project
- All public functions (`def` declarations)
- The project's `__init__.py` registry (if it exists)
- SKILL.md contents (if it exists)

This makes it **structurally difficult** to "not notice" existing code.

### Post-create Validation
After writing code, the script checks:
- Are there duplicate function names across files?
- Does the new file import from established modules?
- Does it contain bypass patterns?

### Import Registry
Each project gets an `__init__.py` that explicitly lists validated functions:

```python
# This is the ONLY approved interface for this project
from .core import validate_data, score_item, generate_report

# New scripts MUST import from here, not reimplement
```

## Origin Story

Born from a real incident (2026-02-02): We built a complete decision engine for prediction market analysis — scoring system, rules parser, news verification, data source validation. Then the AI agent created a "quick scan" script that bypassed ALL of it, sending unverified recommendations. Hours of careful work, completely ignored.

The fix wasn't writing more rules. It was writing code that **mechanically prevents** the bypass.

## Research

Based on research from:
- [Anthropic's Claude Code Best Practices](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices) — *"Unlike CLAUDE.md instructions which are advisory, hooks are deterministic"*
- [Cursor's Scaling Agents](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents) — *"Opus 4.5 tends to stop earlier and take shortcuts"*
- [Guardrails AI Framework](https://www.guardrailsai.com/docs)
- [NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Guardrails)
